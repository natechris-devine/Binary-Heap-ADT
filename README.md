# Binary-Heap-ADT
Date: March 24, 2019
This is a Binary Heap ADT implemented in Python. 

I got my starting point from this website: http://interactivepython.org/courselib/static/pythonds/Trees/BinaryHeapImplementation.html

However, their Binary Heap only allowed a minimum sorting, and only facilitated numbers. 
I added a type to the heap (using the functions maxType and minType) so that the heap could be sorted minimally or maximally.

Additionally, by creating different heap type functions, you can have a binary heap that sorts other objects, not just numbers.
